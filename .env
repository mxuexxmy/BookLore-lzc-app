# User and Timezone Settings
# PUID and PGID define the user/group running the container.
# TZ sets the timezone for correct time-related operations.
PUID=1000      # Default user ID (Check with `id -u` on Linux/Mac)
PGID=1000      # Default group ID (Check with `id -g` on Linux/Mac)
TZ=Etc/UTC     # Change this to your timezone (e.g., America/New_York, Asia/Kolkata)

# Database Credentials (Replace with a secure password)
# This password is used by MariaDB. Make sure to keep it secure.
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=BookLore

# Paths for Docker Volumes (Update these paths as per your system)
# These paths store persistent data for Booklore and MariaDB.
# Replace "/path/to/..." with actual directories on your system.
BOOKLORE_DATA_PATH=/path/to/booklore/data       # Example: /home/user/booklore/data (Stores app-related data)
BOOKLORE_BOOKS_PATH=/path/to/booklore/books     # Example: /home/user/booklore/books (Stores book files)
MARIADB_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/mariadb/config     # Example: /home/user/booklore/mariadb/config (Stores database config)

# How to find your correct paths?
# 1. Choose a location where you want to store persistent data.
# 2. Create the required folders if they donâ€™t exist.
# 3. Use `pwd` in your terminal inside those directories to get the full path.
# 4. Replace `/path/to/...` above with your actual paths.
